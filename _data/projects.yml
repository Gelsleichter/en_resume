   Reproducibility is essential for the quality of Research and Innovation (R&I) but is currently limited.
   In the project, my role is to test and contribute to computational reproducibility, seeking to develop protocols and checklists
   for improvement in R&I.

   The incredible thing about this project was to apply proximal remote sensing to satellite images to almost double the predictive capacity of the model

    Remote Sensing products are applicable for spatial prediction of soil properties, in the process called Digital Soil Mapping (DSM).

    The aim of the study was to combine Vis-SWIR soil laboratory spectra with the DSM technique to create new hyperspectral images 
    to use as covariates in a new soil mapping method. 
    
    The advantages of the method were demonstrated throughout the spatial prediction of Total Carbon content in soils from the upper part of the 
    Itatiaia National Park. Using information from the Vis-SWIR spectra of the upper soil horizon from 72 points in the upper part of INP, 
    130 hyperspectral images were generated, that is, subsurface hyperspectral image. The validation methods were 8-fold cross-validation (CV) 
    and external validation executed using the Random Forest algorithm. 
    
    The DSM achieves a mean determination coefficient (R2) in the CV of 0.39 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.6, while the creation of a new model 
    with a set of hyperspectral images gave a CV R2 of 0.60 and RMSE of 4.06. 
    The method can be applied in dense or low vegetation areas, for agricultural or conservation purposes, for various soil properties, 
    with all and each wavelength.
